end
</pre>

## Instructions ##

All Cj4r Service finders take the same parameters listed in the official [Commission Junction Web Services Help site](http://help.cj.com/en/web_services/web_services.htm).  The only difference is that Cj4r uses the snake_case version of the parameter names.  For example, if a parameter is called `manufacturerName`, you can set it using `manufacturer_name` instead.  Same goes for `advertiserIds`, use `advertiser_ids`.

The current Commission Junction service classes are:

* Cj4r::DailyPublisherCommission
* Cj4r::RealTimeCommission
* Cj4r::ProductCatalogSearch
* Cj4r::AdvertiserSearch
* Cj4r::LinkSearch

Each service class has a `find` method that closely emulates ActiveRecord::Base#find and returns an array containing the web service results.  Each of these records are their own class and have the same attribute names (also camelCased) listed in the 'Per Record' part of each of their [Web Service documentation](http://help.cj.com/en/web_services/web_services.htm).

To get an array of all possible string values for the `language`, `country`, `linkSize`, and `linkType` parameters found in some of the services, Commission Junction provides a Support API, accessible in Cj4r using the Cj4r::Support service class, using the following methods:

* Cj4r::Support.languages(:locale => 'en') _Locale is an optional parameter, set to english by default_
* Cj4r::Support.countries(:locale => 'en') _Locale is an optional parameter, set to english by default_
* Cj4r::Support.link_types
* Cj4r::Support.link_sizes

<pre>
@records = DailyPublisherCommission(:all, :date => Time.local(2008, 'jan', 19))

@records.each do |record|
  record.attributeName1
  # => 'foo'
  record.attributeName2
  # => 'bar'
end
</pre>



## Caveats ##

Some minor things in the API documentation at the [Commission Junction Web Services Help site](http://help.cj.com/en/web_services/web_services.htm) seem to be outdated.  I found the following documentation errors while creating this plugin:

* The Advertiser Search and Link Search services have a `language` parameter which is not included in the documentation.  This parameter just takes a regular string to filter the results by a language.

* The correct string value for all API's to order results in descending order (sortOrder paramater, sort_order in Cj4r) is `desc`, *not* `dec` as indicated by the documentation.

## Examples ##

* Return all transactions that occurred yesterday, sorted by postingDate in descending order (defaults)

<pre>
Cj4r::PublisherCommission.find(:all)
</pre>

* Return all transactions for the event date of January 19, 2007 sorted by commission amount in ascending order

<pre>
Cj4r::PublisherCommission.find(:all,
  :date => Time.local(2008, 'jan', 19),
  :sort_by => 'commissionAmount',
  :sort_order => 'asc')
</pre>
